Software Developer 2 at F5, India. I am part of DNS team for the Classic BIG-IP. I contribute towards GeoIP, DNS Resolvers, GSLB and Cache. I am fellow security Ninja at F5, where I practise as security advocate with TMAs, and also contribute towards safe and secure SDLC.

My interests lie in ML, I have completed my Masters as ML researcher under the guidance of Prof. J Saketha Nath in the field of Optimisation Problems to solve Optimal Transport with Substructure.

I recently developed passion for CTFs. If I'm not coding, I am usually losing MMR in Valorant, Staring at my fish tank or Reading.
